<h1>In this project I am building a neural netwrok from scrath using python and numpy without using pytorch or tensorflow. </h1>
<h3>Status: Everything related to the model is ready. Next step is to actually train the model. I should add that at the moment the backpropagation function assumes that user uses softmax for the last layer and ReLU for hidden layers. Other activation function are available as well, but backpropagation cannot use them at the moment. I will fix this issue asap.</h3>
